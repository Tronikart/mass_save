# Mass Save
A simple quick python script to save a lot of images at once using requests

Simply run it and feed a single string with every url you want with spaces between them, they must be image urls obviously.

example:
`https://example.com/picture1.png https://example.com/picture2.png https://example.com/picture3.png`

Software is given as is, with no warranty of it working, but there are really not a lot of pieces that can break.
